HVM
===

This is the bytecode VM and C runtime for the
[Horse64 programming language](https://horse64.org/).

Usually, you don't want to build or get this manually from
here, but **preferrably, [you usually
want to get the SDK](https://horse64.org/download)**.

But if you really want to, [read how to build it
yourself](BUILD.md). For contributing, [check
the general contribution guidelines](
https://horse64.org/docs/How%20to%20Contribute).
